# Git Gud or Git Goin'
## Overview
This repository contains the materials -- presentation LaTex & PDF files, scripts -- for a presentation I gave in the [Knowles Lab](https://daklab.github.io/) on how to use Git for managing (mostly scientific) code.

## Directory Structure
`src/`: Code, or really scripts.  
`doc/`: LaTex files for my beamer presentation.  

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Stephen Malina, Megan Schertzer for beta-testing the tutorial for me.
